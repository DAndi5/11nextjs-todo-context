## ⚙️ Advancement
The demo app is a static site, a basic single-page-app that has a few
addressable pages that are lazy loaded on-demand. It demonstrates basic CRUD
operations: 1) list todo, 2) view todo details, 3) create/edit and 4)
delete a todo.

The demo uses browser localStorage for the data storage, which means it runs
without a backend.

- ✅ If some user stories are not clear enough, you can take arbitrary decisions.
- ✅ If you don't have time to finish all the user stories, describe the way you'd do them.
- ✅ Describe the edges you don't handle.
- ✅ This project is a real use case at todo List, put the same attention to this project that you would in your real work.
